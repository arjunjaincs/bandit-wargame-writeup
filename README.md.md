# 🏴 OverTheWire: Bandit Wargame – Full Writeup (Levels 0 to 33)

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains my full, level-by-level writeup for the [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame, which is a beginner-friendly but powerful challenge to build Linux command-line, scripting, file system, and networking skills.

🎯 I completed **all 33 levels**, from Bandit0 → Bandit33, learning something new on almost every level.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills Used

Throughout the challenge, I used and practiced with:
- `ssh`, `scp`, `cat`, `ls`, `file`, `strings`, `grep`
- `find`, `tar`, `gzip`, `bzip2`, `cut`, `base64`, `xxd`
- `netcat (nc)`, `nmap`, `telnet`, `tmux`. `git`, more
- Shell redirection (`>`, `<`, `|`), piping, process control
- Basic scripting & chaining commands with logic

## 🧠 Challenges I Learned From Most

Some of the trickier or more insightful levels for me:
- **Level 16:** Logging into another level via `cronjob` password drops
- **Level 20-21:** Setting up your own listener with `nc` and grabbing a connection from the remote side
- **Level 23-24:** Using `tcpdump` to capture and extract passwords from raw traffic
- **Level 25-26+:** Automating binary exploits & manipulating permission bits
- **Level 33:** Escaping a closed shell, trying to break it somehow

## 📘 Why This Matters (Especially for Beginners)

Bandit isn’t just about solving challenges, it's about learning:
- Real Linux file structures
- Tool chaining and manual exploitation
- Thinking like a security analyst or pentester
- Building muscle memory with tools that show up in actual CTFs, internships, and even jobs
